# usecode agent

Messenger for chatting with AI agents.

- `lib/api` — FastAPI backend with server-rendered Jinja2 + HTMX UI and OTP auth API.
- `lib/app` — SCSS source assets compiled into API static CSS.
- `lib/bot` — MCP server that operates usecode agent (wraps `lib/api` as tools for AI agents).

## Run locally

```sh
cd lib/api
uv sync
uv run usecode-agent-api   # http://localhost:8000
```

### Rebuild UI styles (SCSS)

```sh
cd lib/app
npm install
npm run build:css
```

See `lib/app/README.md`, `lib/api/README.md`, and `lib/bot/README.md` for details.

## MCP bot

`lib/bot` is an MCP server that lets an AI agent operate usecode agent (OTP login, session lookup,
logout) against a running `lib/api` instance.

```sh
cd lib/bot && uv sync && uv run usecode-agent-bot   # starts an MCP server over stdio
```

Add it to Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add usecode -- uv run --directory /path/to/usecode/lib/bot usecode-agent-bot
```

See `lib/bot/README.md` for configuration and the full tool list.

## Container registry

`deploy/push.sh` and `deploy/pull.sh` push/pull container images to the registry deployed by
`deploy/playbooks/registry.yaml` (`lib/roles/container-registry`). The registry host is only
reachable through the `shadow` bastion, so both scripts open a local SSH tunnel before logging in.

```sh
# push a local image
./deploy/push.sh myimage:latest

# pull an image, optionally stripping the registry host from the resulting tag
./deploy/pull.sh myimage:latest
./deploy/pull.sh --strip-host myimage:latest
```

Both scripts read the registry password from `deploy/playbooks/vault.yaml` via `ansible-vault`
unless `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is set, and require an SSH host entry (or DNS-resolvable name) for the
bastion, matching `deploy/playbooks/group_vars/main.yml`'s `firewall_bastion_hosts`.
