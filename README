# Zygote: Flexible Runtime for Web Applications

## Introduction
Zygote is a dynamic runtime environment designed to create web applications with versatile interface options, including standard web browsers, VR, voice interaction, and chat interfaces. Its unique feature is the flexibility to run on various platforms, from major cloud providers to personal laptops.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run your applications on cloud services or local machines without dependency on external platforms.
- **API and UI Integration**: Supports both API and human-readable UIs adaptable to various interfaces.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or on personal hardware.

## Getting Started
Clone and install Zygote:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:evgnomon/zygote.git
go install .
```

Initialize your app with Zygote:
```bash
cd MyApp
zygote -i X:azure Y:aws Z:vm1,vm2 run .
```

In this configuration:
- `X`: Represents dependencies such as APIs, open-source databases, or other owned resources.
- `Y`: External resources provided by cloud services.
- `Z`: Virtual machines, either local or cloud-based.

## Unique Selling Points
- **Ownership and Control**: Zygote ensures that key components (X, Y, Z) are under your control, be it API specifications or open-source tools like MySQL.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily switch between cloud providers without breaking your application.

Example commands:
```bash
zygote -i MySQL:aws .       # Run on AWS
zygote stop                 # Stop the application
zygote -i MySQL:azure .     # Switch to Azure with data migration prompt
```

## Contribution and Collaboration
As the owner and maintainer of Zygote, I am committed to ensuring its components are useful and adaptable. Users are encouraged to contribute ideas and improvements. Zygote also supports dual data center configurations for enhanced reliability and flexibility.
