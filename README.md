Creating an MCP backend should be easy! I just name it and get it up an running out of a Git repo with a CI/CD configured. Then iterate to get the desired result by making a pull request. I should see my function deployed after merging with the main branch. This platform is Zygote and you can either use it as a service in [Zygote .Run](https://zygote.run) or host it yourself.

Zygote's kernel named `zcore` and runs over a set of nodes which is owned by you. Each node provides capabilities to the cluster. Use `z` as command line interface (CLI) to interact with the cluster.
