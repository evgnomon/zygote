# Introduction

> Read! Using the name of your provider who makes. No human unless taking and making the source code.

Zygote is a boilerplateless cooperating system kernel for the web! Use it to build web/non-web apps and/or platforms. A modifiable and/or integrated one, permanently licensed under HGL for free, as a foundation for a digital civilization.

Zygote is a guarantee for you to exit by forking everything and to become your own provider and perhaps a cooperating maintainer! Build next gen web appa, next gen social network, bank, tutor etc. Any application and/or platform that a digital civilization needs for you and by you as individual and/or as organization! It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use rather by convention than configuration, yet configurable, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to create web applications/platforms quickly and efficiently! In your preferred programming language of choice, and in your mother tongue and ours perhaps!

Zygote is aware of data replication and sharding, cashing and persistent. So you don't need to know rocket science to reach the escape velocity! The system interface is exposed to the web. Therefore, No boilerplates! Just integrate using your own programming language by performing HTTPs IO. Create an app in your laptop with existing tools that you are convenient with and use Zygote as the kernel to power your function. Your computations scales for the latest user you gain just like the first user without counting how many are in between! Grow, gradually and suddenly while your self custody is guaranteed in the end by Zygote being licensed under HGL for free. Fork it and make it yours and us!

Zygote's kernel named `zcore` and `z` its command line interface (CLI) are written in Go. The system interface is HTTPs based, allowing for easy integration with other other systems and yours. `zcore` and `z` are distributed as two different binaries. You download and use `z` to talk with `zcore`'s system interface.

Zygote is free under HGL. We maintain Zygote as service in [Zygote .Run](https://zygote.run). You pay a small fee (in Bitcoin) and become our tenant if you want to. There might be other providers as well, you can be also one if you choose to! Except our private key, and private user data hosted by us, everything else is publically available including the entire body of code belong to Zygote .Run.

We also suggest the same business model as we have, to be taken by you! for your app/function relying on Zygote. Don't waste a second to code your next building block, the next function of our digital civilization. Yet it is up to you to choose a business model. We suggest you distribute your code under HGL over Zygote .Run, just to start today up running! We provide for you, without hunting your future, just by a small fee! Then provide for yourself, your family, your community by asking fee (in Bitcoin/Lightning) from those you take custody of! And secure an exit for your users and yourself by propagating your functions under HGL. Your users can maintain the code, fork it, and/or modify it on their own. And the best user always contributes back, so you will have the best version of your initial contribution going forward by the best user ever! This let you build a network over your contributions. Then repeat with the next building block on top of the existing.

Save in Bitcoin and invest it to build the next building block of a digital civilization on top Zygote. Share and earn, Educate and Learn. Repeat and Save!

We in Zygote .Run promote your promising contributions among others, unless you choose a different license for your contributions! We only suggest HGL, don't waste your time, otherwise!

> Overall, a direction! Doesn't turn unless toward that, So race non stop! toward virtues, and you never come together unless by one named, who is capable over/by everything.

> Do you follow? You don't care unless based on protocols and/or base protocols unless you don't care!
