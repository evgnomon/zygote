Describe what your functions use from the platform in `.zygote.toml`, leave the rest to Zygote! You have files, memory, tables and event streams managed by Zygote! You don't want to complicate it further before your IPO! Just subscribe to Zygote .Run to kickstart your first function in any programming language now!

Zygote works kind of everywhere! You can install `zygote` binary on your local machine to setup a real local environment (not a mock) for development and testing. Linux, macOS and Windows (Both native and over WSL2) are supported for local development. Also works in your CI. Bultin support for MySQL InnoDB cluster as the general purpose Table store with replication support on commodity nodes and a sharded Redis cluster as In-Memory KeyValue store also as the streaming fabric.

Subscribe to Zygote .Run and run your cloud function in there. Or Install everything on your own machine(s). Zygote is open sourced for you and it is production ready, just fork it and start using it. HGL license also protects Zygote's license being free and stable forever.
