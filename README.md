> No task that you do before using and/or developing AI for. Using and/or developing AI is also a task that we use and/or develop AI for. Soon would be no task that human do better than AI except AI. And we already have everything in this journey except that AI. How to get there? Simple! Just `usecode` and AI for everything.

# Getting Started

Use Debian and/or Ubuntu. You Don't need to replace your Windows tablet or list your MacBook on second hands, you can spin off a Debian/Ubuntu VM on your computer or remote. That way you can just skip Windows and MacOS and get through a Debian/Ubuntu workstation.  

### Development container

The repository includes a project-owned development image for VS Code Dev Containers.
Open the repository in VS Code and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
The Dev Container is configured for nested Podman use; rebuild it after changing the
configuration with **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache** so changes such
as the rootless `uidmap` dependency are installed.

The default Dev Container is deliberately lightweight: it installs development and CLI
tooling, but not IntelliJ IDEA, Rider, Nerd Fonts, GUI applications, hardware-token
packages, QEMU, or host-only image tooling. Set `INSTALL_PROFILE=workstation` only when
running the configurator on a desktop host. Select `.devcontainer/devcontainer.nested.json`
when nested Podman is required; it enables privileged mode and unconfined AppArmor,
which should not be used for untrusted workspaces.

For a standalone Docker or Podman session, build and start it with:

```bash
bash scripts/containerize.sh build
bash scripts/containerize.sh run
```

To build the standalone image that runs `play.sh` during the image build, select the
root Dockerfile explicitly:

```bash
bash scripts/containerize.sh build Dockerfile
```

The script prefers Podman when both runtimes are installed. Set `CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker`
to select Docker explicitly, or set `USECODE_IMAGE` to use a different image tag. Rootless
Podman requires unprivileged user namespaces to be enabled by the host. If the workspace
itself is already inside a container, use the configured Dev Container or run the outer
container with equivalent privileged and AppArmor settings. Nested Podman uses the `vfs`
storage driver because OverlayFS cannot be mounted over the outer container's OverlayFS;
this is slower but works without additional host storage configuration. Inside this Dev
Container, the script uses rootful Podman through passwordless `sudo` to avoid nested
rootless namespace re-exec failures. Set `PODMAN_ROOTFUL=0` to explicitly request rootless
mode. Podman builds use the outer container's network namespace so package repositories
remain reachable when nested netavark DNS is unavailable.

Install `usecode` with a single command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evgnomon/usecode/refs/heads/master/play.sh)
```

Everything is ready in `/build` dir after build, you can run `usecode` with.

As it might take a long time to build `usecode` project, you can use save some time by using a cached build with:

```bash
git clone
cd usecode
make -DCACHED=1
sudo make install
```

Which gives the same `/build` dir with `usecode` ready to run, but with some time saved.

## Distribution
Files in `/dist` are made for distribution, make them using the following command if missing:

```bash
make dist
```
